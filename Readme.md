# IP Helper

Simple tool to read from a file, containing newline splited subnets, in form of "0.0.0.0/8" or "0.0.0.0/255.0.0.0". Then check if the subnet definitions could be simplified, be coverred by some bigger subnets. And output final subnets.

Note: Overlapping checks may not work as expected.
